# TURNT: The Website

Welcome to the new TURNT website!

<!-- more -->

### This Year And Every Year Is The Year of TURNT

The old website sucked and was just a placeholder to dump some tutorials. I found a really cool static site generator and extensions: MkDocs with Material. It allows us to manage content through the git style elim is used to, and re-generates the site every time a new push is made (which will usually be elim's development update blogs).

The vision is for the site to be populated with tutorials and how-tos, command documentation for console nerds, leaderboard integration, as well as the familiar blogs which will still be pushed to discord as well. Another work in progress is a form to submit your ideas and vote for the name of the game, solving that issue once and for all.

Enjoy!
