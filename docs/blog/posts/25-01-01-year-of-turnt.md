# 2025 - The Year of TURNT

Happy new year!

Here's what we've been up to since the last update...

<!-- more -->

* Moving to Godot 4: 2 steps back, 1 step forward - rationale, jolt physics, improvements, delays

* puyo awakens from hibernation, is committing more time lately and in the coming year to give the game some JUICE. First porting features equal to or better than in GD3, initial model and animations for display during spectating/freecam, better options and main menu

* Leaderboard on hold?
